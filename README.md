Modpack is a work in progress, no quests yet!

 

Overview

You awake, alone, everyone and everything you once knew is gone. All that remains are now empty cities, a cruel reminder of what was.

 

You are well versed in the technical and the eldritch, will you be able to survive?

 

Description

This started as a personal pack with an emphasis on harder survival and exploration while including several mods I had minimal exposure to in the past. 

 

The emphasis is on several tech mods with a few choices for logistics. Players will need to use buildcraft gates and some redstone wizardry to do complex automation before they get into the AE2 age. Forestry multifarms are back (and encouraged) as well!

 

Hardcore darkness and tough as nails make this pack tougher than vanilla survival, nights are something to be afraid of again! There may be some mob difficulty mods added in the future so be warned! Pneumaticraft and IE have turrets (hint hint)...

 

The magic side of this mod is completely WIP, they are there for you to experience and free to explore.

 

The goal of this pack is to make you think about your machinery setups, explore the world and to grow your power. Be warned though, the elder gods are watching...
